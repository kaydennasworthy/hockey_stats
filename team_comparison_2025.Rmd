```{r}
library(tidyverse) #install.packages("tidyverse")
data = read_csv("C:\\Users\\kayde\\Desktop\\NHL stats\\Data\\all_teams.csv")

summary(data)

data %>%
  group_by(team, season) %>%
  summarise(total_goalsFor = sum(goalsFor),
            total_goalsAgainst = sum(goalsAgainst),
            total_goalDiff = total_goalsFor - total_goalsAgainst)
```

## Including Plots


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
